# Global-Job-Insights/ Road-Safety-Dashboard

**As part of a challenge for IISc Bangalore, I created a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing road accident data.
Used Power BI to import, clean, and visualize the road accident dataset ("road_accident.xlsx") provided for the challenge.
Implemented data cleaning techniques, including creating a new column for date and time management and defining multiple measures for calculations and visualizations.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations related to accident severity, types, locations, and contributing factors like weather conditions and road types.
Designed interactive visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, maps, and trend lines to represent the data effectively.**

**While the global job insights was done by me during my internship.**
